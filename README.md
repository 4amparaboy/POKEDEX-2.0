## How it works?
The bot has one main command: /data. Using /data <PokémonName> Rotomgram sends in the chat these informations:
- [x] main data (Name, Dex number, Type, Ability)
- [x] Base stats and rating using emoticons
- [x] Official artwork
- [x] Other informations about it (such as EV yield, catch rate, egg groups, etc) accessible through "Expand" inline button
- [x] Moveset
- [ ] Location
- [ ] Minimum/Maximum statistics at level 100
- [ ] Eevolutionary methods
- [ ] Alternative forms informations

Other commands (such as /ability <ability>, /move <move>, etc) send information about that specific thing and the Pokémon that can have/learn it (Work in progress)
